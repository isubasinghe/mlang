# mlang
I want a simple programming language with a garbage collector (like Go) but I want to be able to opt into manual garbage collection for performance. I kind of want to experiment if I could introduce a linear type system so that I have compile time knowledge of the lifetime of a given variable. I don't know how possible this would be, but I am interested in trying it out. So I am messing around with OCaml, Menhir, Sedlex and LLVM.
This is not even halfway done, I contribute here randomly, maybe during the summer break I can contribute more heavily into this.
