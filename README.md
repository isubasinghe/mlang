# mlang
I want a simple programming language with a garbage collector (like Go) but I want to be able to opt into performance. So I am messing around with OCaml, Menhir, Sedlex and LLVM.
This is not even halfway done, I contribute here randomly, maybe during the summer break I can contribute more heavily into this.
